# project_midterm_therolinguistics

The following project, created by squirrels, serves as a translator akin to Google's between the squirrel language and English.

The squirrel language uses the Wingdings alphabet, which uses images and an assortment of symbols instead of letters- squirrels derive characters directly from what they observe.
In addition, the squirrel language syntax is equal to English "pig latin": the first character of each word is placed on the end and "ay" is slapped on the end.

Because this project was created by squirrels it's designed to cater to squirrels, whom by the way use a strikingly similar keyboard to humans.
For example: no phonetics are added because the squirrel language is pronounced in such a unique and exotic way it is impossible to be replicated by humans, and vice versa.
Also, by default the language of the menus is in squirrel and performs Squirrel > English.  This must be changed to English to perform English > Squirrel.

We hope this simple self-serving website serves to enhance your understanding on the therolinguistics of squirrels as well as squirrel culture.
